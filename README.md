## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop an accurate digit recognition system that can classify images of handwritten digits. The model is built using deep learning techniques, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is a popular architecture for image classification tasks.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install jupyter tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
```

## Setup

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or your Google Colab environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TanujRathore/digit-recognizer.git
```

2. Upload the dataset downloaded from the Kaggle competition to the appropriate directory within the project.

3. Open the `Digit_Recognition.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook using Google Colab.

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model and make predictions.

## Usage

1. Open the `Digit_Recognition.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

2. Follow the steps provided in the notebook to understand the dataset, preprocess the data, build the CNN model, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

3. Make predictions on new images using the trained model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is downloaded from the Kaggle competition (provide the link to the competition here). It consists of images of hand-drawn digits from 0 to 9. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, which will be used for training and evaluating the CNN model.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model used for digit recognition is defined as follows:

```python
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(30, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='sigmoid')
])
```

The architecture consists of the following layers:

1. Conv2D layer with 30 filters, kernel size 3x3, and ReLU activation.
2. MaxPooling2D layer with pool size 2x2 for downsampling.
3. Flatten layer to convert the output into a 1D vector.
4. Dense layer with 128 units and ReLU activation as a hidden layer.
5. Dense layer with 64 units and ReLU activation as another hidden layer.
6. Dense layer with 10 units and sigmoid activation as the output layer for multi-class classification.

## Training

The training process involves feeding the preprocessed images into the CNN model and optimizing its parameters using the Adam optimizer. The model is trained over a certain number of epochs to minimize the categorical cross-entropy loss function. The training progress and accuracy are monitored during training.

## Evaluation

After training the model, it is evaluated on the test dataset to measure its accuracy and performance. The accuracy metric is used to assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.

## Inference

Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to make predictions on new images containing handwritten digits. The trained model will classify these digits into the appropriate classes (0 to 9).
